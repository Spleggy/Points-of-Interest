# Points-of-Interest
Android application displaying a map and showing the user's current location (if enabled on app startup), allowing points of interest (POI) to be added as a marker on the map that saves to the device. The app also gives the user the option to automatically upload to the web (no longer supported since web server is inactive).
On startup, the app is able to read in all POIs and add them to the map along with all information stored with them such as name, type and a short description that can all be viewed as a toast popup when tapping the markers.
